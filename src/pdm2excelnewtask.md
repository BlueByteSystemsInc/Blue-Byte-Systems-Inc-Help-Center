## Setup Pages Overview

The setup pages for this task are similar to the default task tabs you may already be familiar with. However, there is a new tab called **Options**. This tab is specifically designed to define the export settings for pulling information from the assembly into the BOM.

For more detailed information about the **Options** tab and its configuration, please refer to the [Options Documentation](/src/pdm2exceloptions.html).
