## Troubleshooting SOLIDWORKS PDM Add-ins

<br>

### Question:  My SOLIDWORKS PDM add-in is not loading. How do I troubleshoot this?

<br>

**Answer:** If your SOLIDWORKS PDM add-in fails to load, it is possible that is blocked by Windows. Follow these troubleshooting steps:

- **Navigate to the File in File Explorer:** Locate the file that you want to unblock using File Explorer.
- **Right-click on the File:** Right-click on the file to open the context menu.
- **Open Properties:** In the context menu, click on "Properties" at the bottom. This will open the Properties dialog box for the file.
- **Unblock the File:** In the Properties dialog box, if the file is blocked, you will see an "Unblock" checkbox near the bottom of the General tab. Check the "Unblock" checkbox if it is present.
- **Apply Changes:** Click the "Apply" button if available, or simply click "OK" to apply the changes.
- **Confirm Unblock:** If the file was successfully unblocked, you may need to reopen the Properties dialog box to verify that the "Unblock" checkbox is no longer present.
- **Access the File:** After unblocking the file, you should now be able to access and use it as intended without any restrictions imposed by Windows' security settings.

>[!NOTE]
>    Files can be blocked by Windows as a security measure primarily to protect your computer from potentially harmful content that may come from external sources, such as the internet or another computer. The main reasons files are blocked include:
>    
>    **Downloaded from the Internet:**
>        - Files downloaded from the internet are often marked as blocked by default. This is to prevent automatic execution of potentially malicious scripts or applications that could harm your system.
>
>    **Attachment in Emails:**
>        - Email attachments, especially those from unknown or untrusted sources, may also be blocked to prevent inadvertent opening or execution of harmful content.
>
>    **Copied from External Sources:**
>        - Files copied from removable media (like USB drives) or network shares may inherit their blocking status from the source, especially if the source is considered untrusted or comes from a different security zone.
>
>    **Security Settings:**
>        - Windows applies security settings to files based on their origin and attributes. This includes marking files with a zone identifier (e.g., from the internet) which triggers the blocking mechanism.
