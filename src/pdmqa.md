1. **Ensure file is not blocked by Windows:**

    Files can be blocked by Windows as a security measure primarily to protect your computer from potentially harmful content that may come from external sources, such as the internet or another computer. The main reasons files are blocked include:
    
    1. **Downloaded from the Internet:**
        - Files downloaded from the internet are often marked as blocked by default. This is to prevent automatic execution of potentially malicious scripts or applications that could harm your system.

    2. **Attachment in Emails:**
        - Email attachments, especially those from unknown or untrusted sources, may also be blocked to prevent inadvertent opening or execution of harmful content.

    3. **Copied from External Sources:**
        - Files copied from removable media (like USB drives) or network shares may inherit their blocking status from the source, especially if the source is considered untrusted or comes from a different security zone.

    4. **Security Settings:**
        - Windows applies security settings to files based on their origin and attributes. This includes marking files with a zone identifier (e.g., from the internet) which triggers the blocking mechanism.
