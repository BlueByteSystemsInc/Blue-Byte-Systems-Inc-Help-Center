# How to Install PDM Add-ins

Installing PDM add-ins from Blue Byte Systems Inc., is a simple process.

## Step 1: Locate the `.cex` File

After purchasing one of our PDM add-ins, you will receive an order email with the header *Thank you for your business! Your BLUE BYTE SYSTEMS INC. order has been completed*. 

This email has a link to download a `.zip` archive that contains a `.cex` file. The `.cex` file is what you open with the Administration tool and it has the latest version of the PDM add-in.

## Step 2: Download and Unblock the `.zip` File

1. Download the `.zip` archive from the link provided in the order email.

2. Once downloaded, right-click on the `.zip` file and select **Properties**.

3. In the **Properties** window, check for the **Unblock** option at the bottom. If it is present, click **Unblock** and then click **OK**. This step ensures that the file is not blocked by Windows security.

> [!NOTE]
> You can always find the latest `.cex` files from the Downloads section in your [Blue Byte Systems account](https://bluebyte.biz/account). **Your account username is the email used to make the order.**

## Step 3: Open the SOLIDWORKS PDM Administration Tool

1. Extract the `.zip` archive file to get the `.cex` file.

2. Launch the **Administration** tool. 

3. Log in to your PDM vault.

## Step 4: Add or Update an Add-in

1. In the **Administration** tool, go to **File > Open...** and browse to the location of the `.cex` file.

2. Select the `.cex` file and click **Open**. This will display the add-in in a new window inside the **Administration** tool.

3. Drag and drop the add-in from the window into the **Add-ins** node in the left-hand tree view.

This process is similar when updating an existing add-in. Simply follow the same steps to replace the old version with the new one.

## Step 5: Verify the Installation

1. After installing or updating the add-in from the `.cex` file, ensure that the add-in appears under the **Add-ins** node. Make sure the version matches with the order email.

2. Test the functionality of the add-in to confirm that it has been installed correctly.
