| **Export Location**                         | Location where to export the files. The location can be within or outside the vault. It is important that the path does **not** end with a backslash (`\`). [Please consult this article to learn more about customizing this field](../src/pdmpublisherspecialvariable.html).      |
| **Filename**                         | Filename of the exported file. You do not need to include the extension. If you include the extension, it will be of the original file not the target extension. [Please consult this article to learn more about customizing this field](../src/pdmpublisherspecialvariable.html).      |
| **File Formats**                            | Specifies the available file formats to export documents to, including formats like PDF, DWG, DXF, U3D, and others.                                            |
| **Export document and its references to file formats individually** | When enabled, affected document and its references will be exported to the selected file format individually.   **Make sure this option is checked to process single documents.**  **If you only want the merged PDF of an assembly, you may uncheck this option to avoid saving individual PDFs in the export location.**           |
| **Merge exported PDFs into one master PDF** | Combines all exported PDFs of the affected assembly into one master PDF file, rather than keeping them separate.                                                 |
| **Ignore sub-assemblies children when condition checks fail**          | When enabled, the children of, sub-assemblies that fail condition check, will be ignored (not processed). |

| **Work with latest version**               | Ensures that the task works with the latest version of the file, automatically fetching the most recent version from the PDM vault.                             |

| **Convert multiple configurations**        | If enabled, the task will attempt to export all part and assembly configurations. The configurations will be saved with the configuration name appended to the filename. |
| **Ask user to select configuration on startup**        | If enabled, the task will prompt the user to select which configuration of the affected document to process on startup. |
| **Archive all exported documents (.zip)**  | Packages all exported documents into a single `.zip` file for easy storage and distribution.                                                                     |
| **Export sheet metal parts to 1:1 flat pattern DXF** | Exports sheet metal parts as DXF files in a 1:1 scale. The filename will have `FlatPattern` appended.                                                            |
| **Use search to locate drawings**          | When enabled, the task will search in the Where Used for the first drawing that references the affected document. |
| **Use Microsoft Print To PDF to save PDFs**          | When enabled, the task will use the Microsoft Print To PDF printer instead of SOLIDWORKS's save as to save PDFs. |

|:--------------------------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Turn on activity tracking**              | Enables tracking of all task activity, generating a detailed log that documents each step performed during the task, which can be saved in the log folder.         |
| **Server-Synced Activity Logs**             | Syncs the activity logs with the server, allowing for centralized storage and review of the task's history, including all performed steps.                        |
| **Log Folder (Vault Only)**                 | Specifies the folder within the PDM vault where log files will be stored. This ensures that logs are maintained in a secure location, following PDMâ€™s file structure. |

### Ensuring Proper BOM Layout for PDMPublisher
In recent versions, we have started using the PDM BOM instead of the SOLIDWORKS BOM. PDMPublisher leverages the first BOM layout in your vault to calculate quantities. To ensure proper functionality, the layout must include a <RefCount> (Quantity) column and a <Configuration> (Configuration name) column. If you are experiencing errors related to the bill of materials layout, verify that these required columns are present in your BOM setup.

### Important Notes About Creating Tasks

Please consider the following recommendations when creating a new task using PDM Publisher:
1. **Execution method**
    1. In the execution method tab that appears on the blue left sidebar, please: 
    2. Choose the radio box option **â€œLet the system decide which computer to execute the taskâ€œ**.
    3. Choose **one computer**. We recommend that our customers opt for the server. The server needs to have a SOLIDWORKS PDM Client installed with a local view as well as SOLIDWORKS 3D.
2. On the first page of the task, execute the task with a user that has the right workflow and file/folder permissions.

> [!TIP]
> We also recommend disabling the auto-add extensions by removing all the extensions the task uses including txt.  
> This prevents race conditions between SOLIDWORKS PDM and the task during files add process.

To change the auto-add extensions list, 
1. *Go to* the PDM Administration tool
2. *Right click* on the username (or all users)
3. *Select* ***Settings***
4. *Click* on the ***Adding Files*** selection and edit the file extensions
