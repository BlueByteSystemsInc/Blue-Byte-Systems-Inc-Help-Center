# Example

This page explains how to configure a PDM Publisher to create a parts book.

## Parts Book

A parts book in manufacturing is a comprehensive reference document that provides detailed information about the various parts and components of a product or piece of machinery.

In our case, the parts book will be created from a top-level assembly.

## Conditions

To create a parts book, you may want to:

- Exclude certain components from the assembly (e.g., parts that are purchased).
- Create a PDF of each component.
- Create a DXF of each sheet metal component.
- Add manufacturing quantities to the printed PDF.
- Add additional notes to the printed PDFs such as the customer name, the project, the batch number, and the time of the print.
- Merge all PDFs together.
