Detailed logs are found in the logs tab. 

Each time you click `Export` button, a new a log called a `Job` with ID is created with detailed steps.

- Yellow lines are regular steps in progress.
- Green lines are successful steps.
- Red lines are errors.

You can clear logs or save them as a `.log` file.

# Advanced debugging

- If you have the `Server-Synced Activity Logs` option checked, you can share the `Job ID` with technical support instead of the `.log` file.
