It allows you to access and update your purchased add-ins and all their versions efficiently.

    - Click **OK** to open the CEX file.
    - Drag and drop the CDPDM add-in icon onto the add-ins node in the administration tool. This will add the add-in into the add-ins node.
6. **Upload the customer configuration file**:

### Updating an Add-in:

1. Right-click on the CDPDM add-in and click on **Update add-insâ€¦**
2. This will show the main dialog of the add-in where you can select from the dropdown list the program you would like to install.
3. Click on the **Install** button to install the selected add-in.
4. The process might take a few moments, so please wait.
5. You will be prompted at the end to restart your PDM session. This allows your local client to get the new version of the installed add-in.
6. You may want to restart the administration tool (conisioadmin.exe) so the add-in reloads properly before you consume your license or create/edit your tasks.
