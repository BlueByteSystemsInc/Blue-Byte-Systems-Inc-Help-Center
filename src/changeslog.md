## 2026-01-16  
*Applies to **SOLIDWORKS Add-in***
- Fixed assembly conflict bug

## 2026-01-15  
*Applies to both **PDM Task** and **SOLIDWORKS Add-in***

- Added a new **Flat Pattern export setting** that removes the **outside diameter of counterbored holes** when exporting **DXF flat patterns**.  
  This helps produce cleaner DXFs for downstream manufacturing by excluding counterbore outer geometry while preserving required cut profiles.
