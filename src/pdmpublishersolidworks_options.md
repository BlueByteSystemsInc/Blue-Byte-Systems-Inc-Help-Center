## Export Location

  - The location can be in or outside  SOLIDWORKS PDM vault.
  - The Browse button allows the user to specify the destination folder for the exported files, making it easy to direct them to any desired location.
  - The export location can be defined dynamically, allowing the destination folder to be determined by the selected file properties.
  - Must not end with `\`.

## Customize Location
Custom export locations based on file extension.

  - Customize location allows users to define export locations based on file extension, ensuring that each file type is assigned a unique destination path. 
  - The checkboxes indicate which file types will be exported to their specified locations. Any file type whose checkbox is not selected will default to the base export location.

> This feature is available exclusively in the full version of PDMpublisher.

## File name (must include extension)

Exported file name(s).
