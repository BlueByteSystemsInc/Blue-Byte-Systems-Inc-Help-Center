# Conditions Setup Page

![alt text](../images/conditions.png)

Conditions can be added to a task to include or exclude files from being processed.  
The task will only process files that evaluate any of the set conditions as *true*.

> [!NOTE]  
> Conditions are applied to references of the top-level assembly (parts or sub-assemblies).

> [!WARNING]  
> PDMPublisher will evaluate only **one root condition** â€” whether it's a **single condition** or a **group** (AND/OR).  
> If multiple root-level conditions are present, only the **first one** will be considered.

##  Nested Groups Support (AND/OR)

PDMPublisher now supports **nested condition groups**, allowing you to create more advanced logical filters using **AND/OR** trees.

> [!TIP]
> You can add a new group by clicking the **+ (AND/OR)** button next to any condition group.
