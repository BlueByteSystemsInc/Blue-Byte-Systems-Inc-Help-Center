This article is about updating any SOLIDWORKS PDM add-in you purchase from Blue Byte Systems Inc using the CDPDM add-in. This tool streamlines the code delivery process for SOLIDWORKS PDM customers by utilizing the CDPDM continuous delivery platform. It allows you to access and update your purchased add-ins and all their versions efficiently.

### Installation Steps:

1. **Download CDPDM**: The link is provided in your *order email* and is also available in the downloads section of your account. This file is an archive zip file and it contains `CDPDM.cex` and `CustomerConfigurationFile.cfg`

> [!Note]
> To install CDPDM after downloading it, please follow the instructions in [this article](/src/cdpdm.html).


> [!Warning]
> **If CDPDM fails to install, the *order email* contains a downloadable CEX file that contains the add-in**.

2. **Unblock the downloaded file**: Right-click on the zip archive and select **Properties**. In the properties dialog, check the **Unblock** option and click **OK**.

3. **Unzip the archive**: Extract the contents of the zip archive.

4. **Open the administration tool**: Log into your vault.

5. **Import the add-in**:
    
    - Go to **File > Open** and browse to `CDPDM.cex` (unzipped content).
    
    - Click **OK** to open the CEX file.
    
    - Drag and drop the CDPDM add-in icon onto the add-ins node in the administration tool. This will add the add-in into the add-ins node.

6. **Upload the customer configuration file**:
    
    - Locate the customer configuration file `CustomerConfigurationFile.cfg`.
    
    - If needed unblock the downloaded configuration file: Right-click on the file, select **Properties**, check the **Unblock** option, and click **OK**.
    
    - Right-click on the CDPDM add-in and click on **Update customer configuration file...**
    
    - Browse to the unblocked customer configuration file and upload it.

4. Click on the **Install Checked Add-Ins...** button to install the selected add-in. The process might take a few moments, so please wait.

5. You will be prompted at the end to restart your PDM session. This allows your local client to get the new version of the installed add-in. *This is optional* but highly recommended for tasks that are triggered from File Explorer.

### Warnings

> [!Warning]
> CDPDM **does not permit** new task add-ins in the *Task Host Configuration*. You must do that manually:

> [!Warning]
> All client computers using the add-in's tasks must be restarted to use the new version.
