File Formats Specifies the available file formats to export documents to, including formats like PDF, DWG, DXF, U3D, and others. Export document and its references to file formats individually When enabled, affected document and its references will be exported to the selected file format individually. Make sure this option is checked to process single documents. If you only want the merged PDF of an assembly, you may uncheck this option to avoid saving individual PDFs in the export location. Merge exported PDFs into one master PDF Combines all exported PDFs of the affected assembly into one master PDF file, rather than keeping them separate. Ignore sub-assemblies children when condition checks fail When enabled, the children of, sub-assemblies that fail condition check, will be ignored (not processed). Print top-level assembly document Adds the top-level assembly to the processing queue. By default, this option is checked. Work with latest version Ensures that the task works with the latest version of the file, automatically fetching the most recent version from the PDM vault. Quick view mode (Drawings Only) Enables quick view mode for drawings to improve performance, especially for large and complex drawings. Convert multiple configurations If enabled, the task will attempt to export all part and assembly configurations. The configurations will be saved with the configuration name appended to the filename. Ask user to select configuration on startup If enabled, the task will prompt the user to select which configuration of the affected document to process on startup. Archive all exported documents (.zip) Packages all exported documents into a single .zip file for easy storage and distribution. Export sheet metal parts to 1:1 flat pattern DXF Exports sheet metal parts as DXF files in a 1:1 scale. The filename will have FlatPattern appended. Use search to locate drawings When enabled, the task will search in the Where Used for the first drawing that references the affected document. Use Microsoft Print To PDF to save PDFs When enabled, the task will use the Microsoft Print To PDF printer instead of SOLIDWORKS's save as to save PDFs. Export History Settings Option Description Turn on activity tracking Enables tracking of all task activity, generating a detailed log that documents each step performed during the task, which can be saved in the log folder. Server-Synced Activity Logs Syncs the activity logs with the server, allowing for centralized storage and review of the task's history, including all performed steps. Log Folder (Vault Only) Specifies the folder within the PDM vault where log files will be stored. This ensures that logs are maintained in a secure location, following PDM’s file structure. BOM Settings Option Description Template Specifies the BOM template to be used. Users can select from available templates in the BOM layout source. By default, the first template will be picked if not specified. Calculation method Defines how the BOM is calculated. Options include As Built and Show Selected. Learn more. Table of Content Settings Option Description Add table of content to merged PDF When enabled, a table of contents will be automatically generated and inserted into the merged PDF, making it easier to navigate and reference the document. Table type Specifies the type of table to include: either a Table of Contents (TOC) or a Simple Bill of Materials (BOM). The BOM includes item descriptions and quantities. Paper size Specifies the paper size used for the table of contents or BOM in the merged PDF. Options include standard sizes like A4, Letter, and others.

Miscellaneous Settings Option Description PDF bookmarks Allows you to define the text pattern for the bookmarks section in the merged PDF, making it easier to navigate between sections within the document. Ensuring Proper BOM Layout for PDMPublisher In recent versions, we have started using the PDM BOM instead of the SOLIDWORKS BOM. PDMPublisher leverages the first BOM layout in your vault to calculate quantities. To ensure proper functionality, the layout must include a (Quantity) column and a (Configuration name) column. If you are experiencing errors related to the bill of materials layout, verify that these required columns are present in your BOM setup. Important Notes About Creating Tasks Please consider the following recommendations when creating a new task using PDM Publisher: Execution method In the execution method tab that appears on the blue left sidebar, please: Choose the radio box option “Let the system decide which computer to execute the task“. Choose one computer. We recommend that our customers opt for the server. The server needs to have a SOLIDWORKS PDM Client installed with a local view as well as SOLIDWORKS 3D. On the first page of the task, execute the task with a user that has the right workflow and file/folder permissions. Tip We also recommend disabling the auto-add extensions by removing all the extensions the task uses including txt. This prevents race conditions between SOLIDWORKS PDM and the task during files add process. To change the auto-add extensions list, Go to the PDM Administration tool Right click on the username (or all users) Select Settings Click on the Adding Files selection and edit the file extensions YouTube playlist"

PDMPublisher creates a Bill of Materials in memory from the top-level assembly. It ignores all suppressed, virtual, envelope, and components that are excluded from the Bill of Materials. Most of these settings come from the component properties dialog. How do the conditions work? Conditions are evaluated for the found PDM reference. If any of the conditions evaluate to true, the reference is added to the processing queue. I cannot see the exported files! Make sure the export location in some where in your vault (or outside your vault) where you have the workflow and folder permissions to add and edit files. The vault's root folder is typically a folder that is locked for adding or editing files by PDM administrators. I have created a task. How can I launch it? PDMPublisher tasks can be attached to a workflow transition or triggered from the right-click menu on a file. You will find your created tasks under Tasks. In the right-click menu, tasks use the name defined the task setup page. See below: Installation Question Answer I'm unable to consume my license Make sure your system/firewall allows for connections to be made to httsp://bluebyte.biz on port 443. Contact us if this problem still persists. I’m running the add-in on assembly and it is not capturing all the references. Make sure that the assembly and its references have local copies on the machine that runs the add-in. You can do that by doing a get-latest on the assembly and its references in the machine that runs the task. This is a by-design behavior of the PDM Publisher. The task is unable to check in the log file. This could be related to a number of issues. You may need to make sure the user running the add-in has proper file and folder permissions on the log folder. You also need to make sure that the txt file extension is NOT part of the auto-add user setting."

    "keywords": "Troubleshooting SOLIDWORKS PDM Add-ins Question: My SOLIDWORKS PDM add-in is not loading. How do I troubleshoot this? Answer: If your SOLIDWORKS PDM add-in fails to load, it is possible that is blocked by Windows. Follow these troubleshooting steps: Navigate to the File in File Explorer: Locate the file that you want to unblock using File Explorer. Right-click on the File: Right-click on the file to open the context menu. Open Properties: In the context menu, click on \"Properties\" at the bottom. This will open the Properties dialog box for the file. Unblock the File: In the Properties dialog box, if the file is blocked, you will see an \"Unblock\" checkbox near the bottom of the General tab. Check the \"Unblock\" checkbox if it is present. Apply Changes: Click the \"Apply\" button if available, or simply click \"OK\" to apply the changes. Confirm Unblock: If the file was successfully unblocked, you may need to reopen the Properties dialog box to verify that the \"Unblock\" checkbox is no longer present. Access the File: After unblocking the file, you should now be able to access and use it as intended without any restrictions imposed by Windows' security settings. Note Files can be blocked by Windows as a security measure primarily to protect your computer from potentially harmful content that may come from external sources, such as the internet or another computer. The main reasons files are blocked include: Downloaded from the Internet: - Files downloaded from the internet are often marked as blocked by default. This is to prevent automatic execution of potentially malicious scripts or applications that could harm your system. Attachment in Emails: - Email attachments, especially those from unknown or untrusted sources, may also be blocked to prevent inadvertent opening or execution of harmful content. Copied from External Sources: - Files copied from removable media (like USB drives) or network shares may inherit their blocking status from the source, especially if the source is considered untrusted or comes from a different security zone. Security Settings: - Windows applies security settings to files based on their origin and attributes. This includes marking files with a zone identifier (e.g., from the internet) which triggers the blocking mechanism."
