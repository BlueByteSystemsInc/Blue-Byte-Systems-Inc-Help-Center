    "keywords": "Continuous Delivery Note This is only available for consulting projects. Our product line has its own CD pipeline. CDPDM is a PDM add-in by Blue Byte Systems Inc. that facilitates the deployment of PDM and task add-ins developed for you. The add-in communicates with our servers and allows the installation and uninstallation of all versions of your PDM add-ins. Advantages The advantages of using CDPDM are numerous: ✔️ No need to ask for or download CEX files. ✔️ Ability to switch between versions. ✔️ The conventional process of installing and updating add-ins is very tedious and time-consuming. Where to Find CDPDM CDPDM is provided in your project kick-off email. The email contains: Link to the CEX file. Link to this page with installation instructions. Link to your Customer Configuration File. How to Install Start by downloading the CEX file. In Windows 11, 10, and 7, internet downloads are blocked. Right-click on the CEX file, go to Properties, check Unblock, then click Apply and OK. Open the Administration tool. Log in to the vault. Please ensure you use a PDM user with Edit Add-Ins permission. In the Administration tool, click File > Open and browse to the CDPDM.cex file. Drag and drop the add-in from the CEX window onto the Add-ins node and wait for a few moments for CDPDM to be installed. Configuration Start by downloading the Customer Configuration File from the project kick-off e-mail. You can upload the Customer Configuration File via the Administration tool. Right-click on the add-in and click Upload Customer Configuration File... Browse to the Customer Configuration File. Note You can configure the settings of CDPDM by adding the credentials of the Customer Configuration File manually. Contact support for help. Updating Add-ins Right-click on CDPDM under Add-ins in the Administration tool and click Update Add-ins... This process may take a few moments depending on how many add-ins are in your vault. You will be prompted with a window like the following: You can: Install the selected add-in from the list. From the Versions Available On Server dropdown, you can select which version to install. Uninstall the selected add-in from the vault (if it is installed). The installation process will ask you if you want to restart PDM. This may be beneficial to do after every upgrade, especially if you're validating a feature. Note Please allow for a few moments after you click Install/Update. The add-in will be downloaded unblocked and added to the vault. This operation includes suppressing some PDM dialog boxes."

The location must be in PDM. Export Export referenced documents of a top-level assembly: This means that if the processed file is an assembly, the task will attempt to export all the available references from the assembly. Merge PDFs? This will merge all exported PDFs. Export all configurations This will attempt to export all configurations of parts and assemblies.

Two options: Using custom property in your sheet format. Task writes quantity to custom property and rebuilds drawing. Define the location and pretext of a note the task adds to drawing before printing to DPF. Use this option if you do not have a predefined custom property in your sheet format Important Notes About Creating Tasks Please consider the following recommendations when creating a new task using PDM Convert Task Extended: Execution method In the execution method tab that appears on the blue left sidebar, please: Choose the radio box option “Let the system decide which computer to execute the task“. Choose one computer. We recommend that our customers opt for the server. The server needs to have a SOLIDWORKS PDM Client installed with a local view as well as SOLIDWORKS 3D. On the first page of the task, execute the task with a user that has the right workflow and file/folder permissions. Tip We also recommend disabling the auto-add extensions by removing all the extensions the task uses including txt. This prevents race conditions between SOLIDWORKS PDM and the task during files add process. To change the auto-add extensions list, Go to the PDM Administration tool Right click on the username (or all users) Select Settings Click on the Adding Files selection and edit the file extensions"

Check the \"Unblock\" checkbox if it is present. Apply Changes: Click the \"Apply\" button if available, or simply click \"OK\" to apply the changes. Confirm Unblock: If the file was successfully unblocked, you may need to reopen the Properties dialog box to verify that the \"Unblock\" checkbox is no longer present. Access the File: After unblocking the file, you should now be able to access and use it as intended without any restrictions imposed by Windows' security settings. Note Files can be blocked by Windows as a security measure primarily to protect your computer from potentially harmful content that may come from external sources, such as the internet or another computer. The main reasons files are blocked include: Downloaded from the Internet: - Files downloaded from the internet are often marked as blocked by default. This is to prevent automatic execution of potentially malicious scripts or applications that could harm your system. Attachment in Emails: - Email attachments, especially those from unknown or untrusted sources, may also be blocked to prevent inadvertent opening or execution of harmful content. Copied from External Sources: - Files copied from removable media (like USB drives) or network shares may inherit their blocking status from the source, especially if the source is considered untrusted or comes from a different security zone. Security Settings: - Windows applies security settings to files based on their origin and attributes. This includes marking files with a zone identifier (e.g., from the internet) which triggers the blocking mechanism."
