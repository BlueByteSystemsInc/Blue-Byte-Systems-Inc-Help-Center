A: Some email providers or company firewalls may block or filter automated emails. To ensure you receive all notifications, please whitelist the domain bluebyte.biz in your email system or spam filter settings. This will help prevent important reminders and alerts from being marked as spam or blocked. Q: What should I do if PDM notifications are not appearing in my inbox? A: SOLIDWORKS PDM notifications are sometimes delivered as internal inbox messages within the PDM client. If you are not receiving these notifications, it may be due to the SOLIDWORKS PDM Database Service not running on the server. To resolve this: On the server, open Database Server Configuration. Make sure the SQL connection is configured with the sa username and password: Open the Windows Services management console (services.msc). Locate SOLIDWORKS PDM Database Service: Ensure the service is started. If it is stopped, right-click and select Start. Q: What else can I do to ensure reliable notification delivery?

File Formats Specifies the available file formats to export documents to, including formats like PDF, DWG, DXF, U3D, and others. Export document and its references to file formats individually When enabled, affected document and its references will be exported to the selected file format individually. Make sure this option is checked to process single documents. If you only want the merged PDF of an assembly, you may uncheck this option to avoid saving individual PDFs in the export location. Merge exported PDFs into one master PDF Combines all exported PDFs of the affected assembly into one master PDF file, rather than keeping them separate. Ignore sub-assemblies children when condition checks fail When enabled, the children of, sub-assemblies that fail condition check, will be ignored (not processed).

Server-Synced Activity Logs Syncs the activity logs with the server, allowing for centralized storage and review of the task's history, including all performed steps. Log Folder (Vault Only) Specifies the folder within the PDM vault where log files will be stored. This ensures that logs are maintained in a secure location, following PDM’s file structure. BOM Settings Option Description Template Specifies the BOM template to be used. Users can select from available templates in the BOM layout source. You must specify this field otherwise the BOM quantity calculation will fail. Calculation method Defines how the BOM is calculated. Options include As Built and Show Selected. Learn more.

Miscellaneous Settings Option Description PDF bookmarks Allows you to define the text pattern for the bookmarks section in the merged PDF, making it easier to navigate between sections within the document. Ensuring Proper BOM Layout for PDMPublisher In recent versions, we have started using the PDM BOM instead of the SOLIDWORKS BOM. PDMPublisher leverages the first BOM layout in your vault to calculate quantities. To ensure proper functionality, the layout must include a (Quantity) column and a (Configuration name) column. If you are experiencing errors related to the bill of materials layout, verify that these required columns are present in your BOM setup. Important Notes About Creating Tasks Please consider the following recommendations when creating a new task using PDM Publisher: Execution method In the execution method tab that appears on the blue left sidebar, please: Choose the radio box option “Let the system decide which computer to execute the task“. Choose one computer. We recommend that our customers opt for the server. The server needs to have a SOLIDWORKS PDM Client installed with a local view as well as SOLIDWORKS 3D. On the first page of the task, execute the task with a user that has the right workflow and file/folder permissions. Tip We also recommend disabling the auto-add extensions by removing all the extensions the task uses including txt. This prevents race conditions between SOLIDWORKS PDM and the task during files add process. To change the auto-add extensions list, Go to the PDM Administration tool Right click on the username (or all users) Select Settings Click on the Adding Files selection and edit the file extensions YouTube playlist"

This feature is especially helpful when configuring multiple vaults, migrating settings, or distributing a standard configuration across teams. Warning Important: Do not copy and paste an existing task in the Administration tool. This can result in broken task settings or outdated references. Instead, always create a new task, then import your previously exported configuration file. Where to Find Import and Export To access the Import and Export buttons: Open the PDM Administration Tool. Right-click on the Tasks node and choose New Task or edit one. In the Select Task Add-in dropdown, choose PDM2Excel if this is a new task. Navigate to the Options tab — you’ll find the Import and Export buttons at the bottom of the page: These buttons allow you to quickly save or load task configurations. How to Export Task Settings Exporting allows you to save your current task configuration to a file: Follow the steps above to reach the Options tab. Click the Export button. Save the file to a safe location. This file includes all configuration details such as BOM layout, file output settings, drawing options, and advanced preferences like cut list support. How to Import Task Settings To import saved task settings into a new task: Right-click on Tasks in the PDM Administration Tool and choose New Task. Select PDM2Excel from the add-in dropdown. In the Options tab, click the Import button. Choose the task settings file that was previously exported. Your task will now be populated with all previously saved configurations. This method ensures stability and compatibility across versions and vaults. Best Practices Always export your configuration before making major changes. Use Import to replicate tasks instead of duplicating them manually. Label your exported configuration files clearly (e.g., PartsOnly_Export_VaultX). Re-import task settings after upgrading to a newer version of PDM2Excel."

In recent versions, we have started using the PDM BOM instead of the SOLIDWORKS BOM. PDMPublisher will leverage the first BOM layout in your vault to calculate quantities. The layout must include a (Quantity) column and a (Configuration name) column. How does PDMPublisher calculate the BOM quantities? PDMPublisher creates a Bill of Materials in memory from the top-level assembly. It ignores all suppressed, virtual, envelope, and components that are excluded from the Bill of Materials. Most of these settings come from the component properties dialog. How do the conditions work? Conditions are evaluated for the found PDM reference. If any of the conditions evaluate to true, the reference is added to the processing queue. I cannot see the exported files! Make sure the export location in some where in your vault (or outside your vault) where you have the workflow and folder permissions to add and edit files. The vault's root folder is typically a folder that is locked for adding or editing files by PDM administrators. I have created a task. How can I launch it? PDMPublisher tasks can be attached to a workflow transition or triggered from the right-click menu on a file. You will find your created tasks under Tasks. In the right-click menu, tasks use the name defined the task setup page. See below: Installation Question Answer I'm unable to consume my license Make sure your system/firewall allows for connections to be made to httsp://bluebyte.biz on port 443. Contact us if this problem still persists. I’m running the add-in on assembly and it is not capturing all the references. Make sure that the assembly and its references have local copies on the machine that runs the add-in. You can do that by doing a get-latest on the assembly and its references in the machine that runs the task. This is a by-design behavior of the PDM Publisher. The task is unable to check in the log file. This could be related to a number of issues. You may need to make sure the user running the add-in has proper file and folder permissions on the log folder. You also need to make sure that the txt file extension is NOT part of the auto-add user setting."
