    "title": "Options Setup Page | Products Helper Center",
    "keywords": "Options Setup Page When you choose PDM Task Convert Extended from the dropdown in the new task dialog, you will be prompted a window that is similar to the one below: Option Description Output This is where you specify the location where you want the exported documents to be saved. This location can be inside or outside the vault. Extensions These are the extensions the task should export. Supported extensions are: PDF DXF DWG IGES X_T STEP eDrawings eprt easm edrw U3D (3D PDF) HTML (You need eDrawings Professional 2019-2023 installed on the machine that runs the task.) Logging Specify if you want the logs to be stored in the cloud. Specify where you want the logs to be saved. The location must be in PDM. Export Export referenced documents of assemblies: This means that if the processed file is an assembly, the task will attempt to export all the available references from the assembly. Merge referenced documents This will merge all exported PDFs. Export all configurations This will attempt to export all configurations of parts and assemblies. Please make sure you include the configuration name alias in the output filename. Work with latest version Task will attempt to get the latest version of the file to be printed. QuickView Opens documents in quick view or large design mode. This option will increase performance with large documents. Archive Creates a zip file of the processed files Applies conditions Does not apply conditions when processing assemblies. Export sheet metal parts When enabled, task attempt to open referenced sheet metal parts from their drawing document and export their flat pattern as the specified dxf or dwg extension. This option will not work if drawings are opened in quick view mode. The notation flatPattern will be appended to the filename of the flat pattern. Watermark Add a watermark to the printed PDF. You can use the special value ($CustomProperty) if the value of the desired watermark is found in a custom property. Quantity Add the document quantity from the calculated BOM of the top-level assembly. Two options: Using custom property in your sheet format. Task writes quantity to custom property and rebuilds drawing. Define the location and pretext of a note the task adds to drawing before printing to DPF. Use this option if you do not have a predefined custom property in your sheet format Important Notes About Creating Tasks Please consider the following recommendations when creating a new task using PDM Convert Task Extended: Execution method In the execution method tab that appears on the blue left sidebar, please: Choose the radio box option “Let the system decide which computer to execute the task“. Choose one computer. We recommend that our customers opt for the server. The server needs to have a SOLIDWORKS PDM Client installed with a local view as well as SOLIDWORKS 3D. On the first page of the task, execute the task with a user that has the right workflow and file/folder permissions. Tip We also recommend disabling the auto-add extensions by removing all the extensions the task uses including txt. This prevents race conditions between SOLIDWORKS PDM and the task during files add process. To change the auto-add extensions list, Go to the PDM Administration tool Right click on the username (or all users) Select settings Click on the “Adding Files” selection and edit the file extensions"
