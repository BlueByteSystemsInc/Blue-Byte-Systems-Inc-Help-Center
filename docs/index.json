Contact us if this problem still persists. I’m running the add-in on assembly and it is not capturing all the references. Make sure that the assembly and its references have local copies on the machine that runs the add-in. You can do that by doing a get-latest on the assembly and its references in the machine that runs the task. This is a by-design behavior of the PDM Convert Task Extended. The task is unable to check in the log file. This could be related to a number of issues. You may need to make sure the user running the add-in has proper file and folder permissions on the log folder. You also need to make sure that the txt file extension is NOT part of the auto-add user setting."

Logging Specify if you want the logs to be stored in the cloud. Specify where you want the logs to be saved. The location must be in PDM. Export Export referenced documents of assemblies: This means that if the processed file is an assembly, the task will attempt to export all the available references from the assembly. Merge referenced documents This will merge all exported PDFs. Export all configurations This will attempt to export all configurations of parts and assemblies. Please make sure you include the configuration name alias in the output filename. Work with latest version Task will attempt to get the latest version of the file to be printed. QuickView Opens documents in quick view or large design mode. This option will increase performance with large documents. Archive Creates a zip file of the processed files Applies conditions Does not apply conditions when processing assemblies. Export sheet metal parts When enabled, task attempt to open referenced sheet metal parts from their drawing document and export their flat pattern as the specified dxf or dwg extension. This option will not work if drawings are opened in quick view mode. The notation flatPattern will be appended to the filename of the flat pattern. Watermark Add a watermark to the printed PDF. You can use the special value ($CustomProperty) if the value of the desired watermark is found in a custom property. Quantity Add the document quantity from the calculated BOM of the top-level assembly. Two options: Using custom property in your sheet format. Task writes quantity to custom property and rebuilds drawing. Define the location and pretext of a note the task adds to drawing before printing to DPF. Use this option if you do not have a predefined custom property in your sheet format Important Notes About Creating Tasks Please consider the following recommendations when creating a new task using PDM Convert Task Extended: Execution method In the execution method tab that appears on the blue left sidebar, please: Choose the radio box option “Let the system decide which computer to execute the task“. Choose one computer. We recommend that our customers opt for the server. The server needs to have a SOLIDWORKS PDM Client installed with a local view as well as SOLIDWORKS 3D. On the first page of the task, execute the task with a user that has the right workflow and file/folder permissions. Tip We also recommend disabling the auto-add extensions by removing all the extensions the task uses including txt. This prevents race conditions between SOLIDWORKS PDM and the task during files add process. To change the auto-add extensions list, Go to the PDM Administration tool Right click on the username (or all users) Select Settings Click on the Adding Files selection and edit the file extensions Conditions Setup Page Conditions can be added to a task to include or exclude files from being processed. The task will only process files that evaluate all of the set conditions as true. Note The condition above for example will only allow files where the Part Type variable from the @ tab is different than the value Purchased. To add a condition, click the Add button. Condition Options Option Description Variable Variable name with the run the condition on. Condition Type Operation type to process. Value Value to evaluate the condition against. Configuration Configuration: Specify the configuration from which to get the value of the variable. Use @ in general.

A note is defined by: Location Use the sliders on the right side of the note text area to define the location. Value The text area allows combinations of text and special values.
